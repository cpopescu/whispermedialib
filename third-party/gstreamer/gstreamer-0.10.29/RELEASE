Release notes for GStreamer 0.10.29 "It's a Trap"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.


The 0.10.x series has been reworked for threadsafety.  It also features
various feature additions and enhancements.


This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * improve plugin loading robustness: do not ever unload a plugin after calling into it: should fix mystery crashers during registry loading when a plugin init function returns FALSE (e.g. when some supporting library fails to initialise or a wrapper plugin found no features to wrap and wrongly returned FALSE)
      * configurable memory alignment for GstBuffers
      * add QoS message to inform apps of lost data, dropped frames etc.
      * basesink, basetransform: add support for new QoS message
      * basetransform: accept non-fixed caps suggestions
      * basesrc: fix gst_base_src_new_seamless_segment()
      * GstController fixes and optimisations
      * set thread name for pad tasks on Linux
      * pipeline, bin: fix refcount issue when removing elements during a state change
      * queue2: implement seeking in download mode
      * queue2: implement flushing in download buffering
      * queue2: improve buffer level measurement in download mode
      * fdsrc: allow specifying the size in bytes on the uri
      * build fixes: better checks for uint128_t, inline assembly on OSX, compilation if HAVE_REGISTER_PRINTF_SPECIFIER is undefined, gobject-introspection
      * two symbols were removed that had been exported but never been used or been declared in any header file: gst_element_default_error and gst_element_request_compatible_pad
